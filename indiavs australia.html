        WICKET! Two wickets in two balls. First a run out and now Yastika Bhatia has been trapped in front of the stumps. The Australian team appeals and the umpire gives that out. Bhatia has gone upstairs. That's pitching in line, impact in line and wickets are umpire's call which means AUSTRALIA HAVE WON IT. India are bundled out for 152 to lose the gold medal match by 9 runs. They will take SILVER!
